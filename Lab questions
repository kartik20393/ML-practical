1. Install and set up Python and essential libraries like NumPy and pandas. 
2. Introduce scikit-learn as a machine learning library. 
3. Install and set up scikit-learn and other necessary tools. 
4. Write a program to Load and explore the dataset of .CVS and excel files using 
pandas. 
5. Write a program to Visualize the dataset to gain insights using Matplotlib or Seaborn 
by plotting scatter plots, bar charts. 
6. Write a program to Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and perform 
feature scaling. 
7. Write a program to implement a k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classifier using scikit-
