Program 1: Install and Set Up Python and Essential Libraries (NumPy and pandas)

Step 1: Install Python

Download Python:

    Visit the official Python website: python.org.
    Click on “Downloads” and download the latest version for Windows.

Install Python:

    Run the downloaded installer.
    Check the box that says “Add Python 3.x to PATH”.
    Click on “Customize installation” and ensure you select all options, including “pip”.
    In the "Advanced Options," select "Install for all users" and set the installation path to C:\Python.
    Click “Install” to complete the process.

Step 2: Verify PIP Installation

PIP usually comes with Python 3.4 and later. To check if it is installed:

    Open Command Prompt.
    Type pip --version and press Enter.

If PIP is missing or needs an update, run the following command:

    python -m ensurepip --upgrade

To confirm PIP is installed, type:

    python -m pip --version

Step 3: Create a Workspace

    Create a folder for your machine learning projects. Open Command Prompt and type:

          

    C:\> mkdir C:\ML_Projects
    C:\> cd C:\ML_Projects

        

Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps keep your projects organized and prevents conflicts between libraries:

    Install the virtual environment tool:

          

pip install virtualenv

    

Create a new virtual environment called ml_env:

      

python -m venv ml_env

    

Activate the virtual environment:

      

    ml_env\Scripts\activate

        

When activated, any libraries you install will only affect this environment. To exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate.

Step 5: Install Essential Libraries

With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary libraries:

Upgrade PIP:

      

(ml_env) C:\> python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    

Install the necessary libraries:

      

(ml_env) C:\> pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn

    

Step 6: Verify the Installation

To ensure everything is set up correctly, verify the installations:

Check Python Installation:

    Open Command Prompt and run:

          

    python --version

        

You should see the version of Python you installed.

Check PIP Installation:
Run the following command to verify PIP:

      

pip --version

    

Check Installed Libraries:
Confirm the installation of the essential libraries by running the following commands in the Python interpreter (make sure to activate your virtual environment first):

      

import numpy
print(numpy.__version__)

import pandas
print(pandas.__version__)

import matplotlib
print(matplotlib.__version__)

import sklearn
print(sklearn.__version__)

    

If there are no errors and you see the version numbers, then the libraries are installed correctly.
