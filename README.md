ML-practical

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for



Repository Overview:
Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning Lab Programs designed for the 6th Semester students of the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Bengaluru City University. 
This repository contains a collection of lab assignments, coding exercises that provide hands-on experience with various machine learning concepts and algorithms.

Features:

    Implementations of common machine learning algorithms
    Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
    Model training, evaluation, and tuning
    Visualizations for better understanding of data and model performance
    Organized notebooks and scripts for easy navigation

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher
    pip (Python package installer)
    Git (for cloning the repository)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

      

git clone https://github.com/kartik20393/ML-practical.git

    

Step 2: Navigate into the Directory

      

cd ML-practical

    

Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

      

python -m venv venv

    

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

          

venv\Scripts\activate

    

On macOS/Linux:

      

    source venv/bin/activate

        

Step 4: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

      

pip install -r requirements.txt

    

(Note: If requirements.txt is not present, you can manually install common ML libraries:)

      

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

    

Execution Instructions
Running Jupyter Notebooks

Most projects and exercises are likely contained within Jupyter notebooks.

    Launch Jupyter Notebook:

          

    jupyter notebook

        

    Your browser will open a Jupyter interface. Navigate through the notebooks to explore different ML projects.
    Click on a notebook file (.ipynb) to open and run the code cells sequentially.

Running Python Scripts

If scripts are provided:

    Run a script using:

          

python script_name.py

    

Follow any instructions or input prompts as necessary.
